This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance can become very slow, especially when using complex components within the FlatList. The issue is caused by the way FlatList renders and re-renders items.  When the data changes, the FlatList needs to update its internal state and re-render the entire list. This can be very time-consuming for a large dataset.
