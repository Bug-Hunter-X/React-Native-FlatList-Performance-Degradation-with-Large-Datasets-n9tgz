To solve this issue, we can implement several optimizations to improve the performance of the FlatList. Here are some of the strategies:

1. **`keyExtractor`:**  This prop is crucial. It provides a unique key for each item in the list. Without this, FlatList has to compare objects, leading to many unnecessary re-renders.  Ensure each key is unique.

2. **`getItemLayout`:** This prop helps FlatList to measure the items more efficiently.  It lets FlatList know the size of each item before rendering.

3. **Virtualization:** If the dataset is extremely large, consider using a more advanced virtualization technique such as `react-native-fast-image` for image loading or windowing libraries that only render visible items.

```javascript
// FlatListBugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { FlatList, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

const data = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => ({ key: i.toString(), value: `Item ${i}` }));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        data={data}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.key}
        renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.value}</Text>}
        getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
          length: 30,
          offset: 30 * index,
          index,
        })}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```
